## Motivation

Form management in React has always been a pain point for me. Not due to the lack of expressiveness, but due to the need to manually having to set up every field with its own event handlers, creating a property for it in the state, and possibly adding quite the amount of case-by-case code if you need adjusted validation per field.

This is fine for one or two fields in an application. If you need dozens of fields, this can quickly become an unmaintainable mess.
